### Description
This Github repository contains my code to the [second assignment](https://www.pic.ucla.edu/~rsalazar/pic10c/assignments/hw2/) for PIC 10C, Winter 2019 with Prof. Salazar.

  
For this assignment, I have created a grade calculator in Qt Creator for both PIC 10B and PIC 10C courses. The grade calculator accounts for all assignments and exams, as well as the different grading schemes.
